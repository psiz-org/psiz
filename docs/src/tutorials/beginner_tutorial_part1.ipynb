    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The Beginner Tutorial Part 1 uses simulated (fake) data in order to keep things simple (see Part 2 for an application that uses real data). The tutorial covers the path from problem formulation, data preparation, model inference, and model analysis. The tutorial aims to teach the basic organization and mechanics of PsiZ, giving readers the background necessary to use PsiZ in their own projects. Some familiarity with TensorFlow is assumed. In order to provide a relatively gentle introduction, this tutorial bypasses some best practices and more advanced features.\n",

While this tutorial uses fake stimuli, PsiZ is designed to model psychological representations of the real-world: such as images, audio, movies, words, odors, and text. After completing this tutorial you should have a good idea how to use PsiZ with your own data.\n",

    "### Solving with PsiZ\n",
    "\n",
    "PsiZ uses formal models to understand mental representations. Since mental representations are not directly observable, we use statistical inference to identify the psychological representations that are most likely to explain observable behavior. A PsiZ model has two conceptual stages: (1) mapping a stimulus to a psychological representation (i.e., into a psychological space) and (2) mapping psychological representations to observable behavior. Each of these stages can be arbitrarily complex, but at a minimum we expect at least three model components: a *percept* module, *proximity* module, and *behavior* module ({numref}`fig-model-flow-1`). The percept module and proximity module work hand-in-hand to map a stimulus to a psychological representation. The behavior module details how the psychological representations yield the observed behavior. These modules are discussed in more detail below when we construct our first model.\n",

Agent information includes details about the human or computer agent (e.g., a personal identifier, experimental condition). The \"wires\" in the diagram show the flow of information through the model; from inputs, to percept module, to proximity module, to behavior module, to outputs. Agent (yellow) and stimulus (blue) information can influence the percept, proximity and behavior modules.\n",

    "### Choosing a Task\n",
    "\n",
    "Many tasks can be used to ellicit obserable behavior, but a handful of tasks are particularly popular for probing psychological representations. Popular tasks include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **pairwise rating**: given two stimuli, rate the similarity of the two stimuli on a numerical scale (e.g., 1 to 7)\n",
    "* **triplet similarity**: given 1 stimulus, choose which of two additional stimuli is most similar\n",
    "* **odd-one-out**: given three images, select the image that doesn't belong\n",
    "* **categorization**: given an image, provide the category label.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some tasks will be better suited for certain stimuli. For example, if judging the similarity between odors, odors will need to be presented separately to prevent the odors from mixing; this makes sequential pairwise ratings a good task. In contrast, if using images as stimuli, multiple images can be shown simultaneously by tiling them on the display; allowing for a wider variety of tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In this tutorial, we use the triplet similarity task.** In a triplet similarity task, one stimulus serves as a *query* and two stimuli serve as *references*. The participant is tasked with selecting the reference that is most similarity to the query. A triplet similarity task is a special case of a more general *rank similarity* task. In a rank similarity task, a participant is shown `n_reference` references and must make `n_select` selections while also indicating the ranking of their selections. For the remainder of the tutorial we will refer to the triplet similarity task as a *2-rank-1* task."

The same person might even give different reponses for the same trial, at different points in time (i.e., within-subject variability). The inference procedure will find the embedding that best satisfies all the (potentially noisy) triplet constraints.\n",

    "### What about the differences between the two embeddings?\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the coordinates for the inferred embedding do not overlap with the corresponding coordinates of the virtual agent. We have already confirmed that the two models have similar losses, so what's going on? While this difference may seem meaningful from the perspective of L2 (Eulcidean) distance, it is important to remember that similarity (not distance) is the critical quantity in these models. In these models, similarity decays exponentially with increasing distance. This means that two stimuli that are moderately far apart and extremely far apart will both have a small similarity. As a consequence there are a large number of equally good solutions for embedding dissimilar items. In contrast, the relatively similar items constrain which solutions are viable. This flexibility means that visual inspection is fine for initial exploration, but it is not a great way to *compare* embeddings. To make comparisons, we need an alternative strategy."

    "### Second-Order Isomporphism\n",
    "\n",
    "Embedding coordinate visualizations yield figures that provide a general picture of the learned solution. But coordinates only tell part of the story. It is more important that the emeddings correctly model pairwise similarity between items. Since similarity is often a non-linear function, focusing on Euclidean distances between coordinates can be misleading. A summary of similarity can be obtained by assembling a pairwise similarity matrix $\\mathbf{s}$, where the matrix element $s_{ij}$ contains the computed similarity between stimulus $i$ and stimulus $j$. \"Unrolling\" (i.e., reshaping) the matrix into a one dimensional array allows us to easily compare two pairwise similarity matrices.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "Depending on the proximity function, some elements of the matrix elements should be omitted from the comparison. For instance, if self-similarity (i.e., diagonal ) values are uninformative, they should be excluded since they may artificially inflate the comparison. In this tutorial, self-similarity is always `1` so we exclude the diagonal elements. If the proximity function is symmetric (`s(z_0,z_1) = s(z_1, z_0)`), it is not necessary to compute both $s_{ij}$ and $s_{ji}. Instead one can compute just the upper (or lower) triangular portion of the similarity matrix. Since our similarity function is symmetric we will only compute the upper triangular portion.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A popular method of comparison is to compute the Pearson correlation between two unrolled similarity matrices. This method of comparison allows us to evaluate the extent that models exhibit *meaningful* differences. This kind of analysis has been around a long time in psychology. For example, Sheperd framed this analysis as focusing on second-order isomorphism (similarity matrix equivalency) rather than focusing on first-order isomorphism (coordinate equivalency) {cite}`Shepard_Chipman_1970`. Today, cognitive scientists often refer to this kind of analysis as representational similarity analysis (RSA) {cite}`Kriegeskorte_Mur_Bandettini_2008`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "There are multiple strategies for comparing similarity matrices, such as canonical correlation analysis (CCA). Each approach has its strengths and weaknesses. Pearson correlation provides a simple, but intuitive strategy. In a research setting, the optimal comparison strategy will depend on the details of the project.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, computing a pairwise similarity matrix is expensive in terms of computational and storage costs. While the costs are minimal for this small stimulus set, PsiZ is designed to scale to large problems. For this reason, pairwise similarity is computed using a batch strategy. We start by creating a dataset of index pairs via the `psiz.data.Rate` object."
