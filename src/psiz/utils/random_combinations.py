def random_combinations(a, k, n_sample, p=None, replace=True, rng=None):
    """Sample from the possible k-combinations of `a`.

    Args:
        a: The elements used to create combinations.
            shape=(n_element,)
        k: Integer indicating the number of elements in each
            k-combination.
        n_sample: Integer indicating the number of unique combinations
            to sample. If `replace=False`, then there is a limit on the
            number of unique samples; if `n_sample` is greater than
            number of unique k-combinations, an exhaustive list of all
            k-combinations is returned (which will be less than the
            requested number of samples).
        p (optional): The sampling probability associated with each
            element in `a`. If not given, all elements are given equal
            probability.
            shape=(n_element,)
        replace (optional): Boolean indicating if the sampling is with
            or without replacement. The default is `True`, meaning that
            a particular k-combination can be sampled multiple times.
            If unique samples are desired, set `replace=False`.
        rng (optional): A NumPy random number generator that can be
            used to control stochasticity.

    Returns:
        samples: A set of k-combinations. If `replace=False`, the
            returned array is sorted both within a sample and across
            samples.
